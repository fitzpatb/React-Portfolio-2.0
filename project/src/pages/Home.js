              My name is Brett Fitzpatrick. I have recently found a passion for technology, computers and coding. Following years in  sales, I slowly found out that sales was simply not for me. honing my skills in everything to do with Full Stack Web Development since July 2020 and since then I have built a vast knowledge and skill with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I really enjoy getting to be creative and solve problems and I have found that learning how to code fits my personality and lifestyle. Through my journey I have learned a number of tools,languages, and databases from Bootstrap, Heroku, React, Handlebars, MySQL and MongoDB.
